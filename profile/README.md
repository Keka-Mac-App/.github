## What is Keka?

**Keka** is a macOS archiving utility built to simplify file compression and extraction, giving users a clean and efficient workflow for handling multiple archive formats. Instead of dealing with complex settings or slow interfaces, Keka provides a lightweight way to compress files in seconds with drag-and-drop actions directly to the app icon or window.

Keka supports a wide list of popular formats, including ZIP, 7Z, TAR, and RAR extraction, making it an all-in-one toolkit for data packaging, sharing, and storage preparation. Users can also generate encrypted archives to protect sensitive data, ensuring information security across local storage, external drives, or cloud sync folders.

The app includes advanced compression settings for users who want maximum file size reduction, while still offering simple default modes for everyday operations. For professionals working with large project folders or media content, Keka handles batch processing smoothly without performance drops.

Keka is optimized for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, delivering fast processing speeds and snappy responsiveness when compressing or unpacking multi-gigabyte files. With a native macOS interface, it blends perfectly into daily Mac workflows without unnecessary complexity.

For Mac users looking for a modern, reliable, and easy-to-use archive manager, Keka provides a complete solution for packaging, securing, and extracting files with speed and precision.
